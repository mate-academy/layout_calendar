Don't use JS.\n\n- Write styles in `src/styles/main.scss` instead of `src/style.css`.\n- This task does not have tests so you need to check if it works as expected manually.\n- Create a markup for the calendar block with 31 days inside\n  - DON'T add numbers in HTML (you will do it using CSS)\n- Each day is a grey (`#eee`) `100px` square (including 1px black border)\n  - Add a number (`Arial 30px`) in the center of each day using `::before` and [@for](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/for)\n- Use flex with `1px` gap and limit its width to exactly 7 columns + `10px` paddings\n  - Don't use hardcoded `px` values if they are used several times\n  - Use properly named variables to make all the calculations more clear.\n- Implement `start-day` modifier for the `calendar` with `mon`, `tue`, `wed`, `thu`, `fri`, `sat` and `sun` values\n  - Use [@each](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/each) to create all the modifiers\n  - The month should start at the correct column (Monday is the 1st, Friday is the 5th)\n  - You can just add correct `margin-left` for the first day\n  - Set calendar to start from Sunday by default\n- Add a modifier `month-length` for the `calendar` with values 28, 29, 30 and 31 (use `@for`)\n  - It sets the last day to show (use [nth-child](https://css-tricks.com/how-nth-child-works/))\n  - Set 31 days by default\n\nOn hovering over a cell:\n- cursor should become pointer\n- The hovered cell has to become pink (use `#FFBFCB`)\n- Move the hovered cell up by `20px` (use `transform`)\n- All changes should be animated with the duration of 0.5s\n\n> Here are the [Layout Tasks Instruction](https://github.com/mate-academy/layout_task-guideline#how-to-solve-the-layout-tasks-on-github)\n\n![reference image](reference.png).\n\n## Checklist\n\n❗️ Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username and copy the links to `Pull Request` description:\n\n- [DEMO LINK](https://marinatea.github.io/layout_calendar/)\n- [TEST REPORT LINK](https://<your_account>.github.io/layout_calendar/report/html_report/)\n\n❗️ Copy this `Checklist` to the `Pull Request` description after links, and put `- [x]` before each point after you checked it.\n\n- [ ] Changing 'month-lengh' and 'start-day' modifier in the code element\nreflects in changing calendar layout\n- [ ] Each day has no modifiers, only class (eg. calendar__day)\n- [ ] All `Typical Mistakes` from `BEM` lesson theory are checked.\n- [ ] Code follows all the [Code Style Rules ❗️](https://mate-academy.github.io/layout_task-guideline/html-css-code-style-rules)\n"
